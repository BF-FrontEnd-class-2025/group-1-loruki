# Communication

## Group Rules

After dividing the tasks, each group member performs their task locally and
after completing the task or when additional communication is needed, they
report it in Slack. Without the consent of the team, a group member does not
perform a pull request.

## Asking for Help

There's a fine line between confidently learning from your mistakes, and
stubbornly getting no where. Here is a general guide for when to ask for help
based on how long you've been stuck on the same problem:

1. _0 -> 30 min_: Try on your own
2. _30 -> 60 min_: Ask your group for help
3. _60+ min_: Tag your ask Sam's help
